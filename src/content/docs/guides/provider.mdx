This page describes APIs that `FabrixProvider` has.

## `url`

The GraphQL API endpoint to make requests to by fabrix.

```diff lang="tsx"
const Providers = (props: React.PropsWithChildren) =>
  <FabrixProvider
+   url="https://api.example.com/graphql"
  >
    {props.children}
  </FabrixProvider>
```

## `componentRegistry`

The prop to provide [a component registry](/docs/guides/component-registry).

## `serverSchema`

<OptionalBadge />

GraphQL schema of the server. This prop accepts a string or [`GraphQLSchema`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema) type.

Usually, you don't need to provide this prop because Fabrix fetches the schema from the server automatically. 
However, if you want to provide the schema manually, you can do so with this prop.

## `prependExchanges`

<OptionalBadge />

Fabrix internally uses [urql](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql) to make requests to the GraphQL API, and `FabrixProvider` has a prop to prepend exchanges (`prependExchanges`) to the urql client.

```diff lang="tsx"
const Providers = (props: React.PropsWithChildren) =>
  <FabrixProvider
    // ...
+    prependExchanges={/* add your own urql exchanges here */}
  >
    {props.children}
  </FabrixProvider>
```

The minimum implementation of urql exchange to set authentication header from your environment variable for each request is as follow:

```ts
import { authExchange } from "@urql/exchange-auth";

export const dumbAuthExchange = authExchange(async (utils) => {
  return {
    addAuthToOperation: (operation) => {
      return utils.appendHeaders(operation, {
        Authorization: `Bearer: ${process.env.AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN}`,
      });
    },
    didAuthError: () => false,
    refreshAuth: () => Promise.resolve(),
  };
});
```

To customize exchanges, see more at [authoring exchanges](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/urql/docs/advanced/authoring-exchanges/) in urql documents.
