Component registry also has a funcionality to dynamically create a React component that wraps `FabrixComponent`. That's what we call a custom component builder.

Major usecase for this is to create a custom component that has more precise control of the component with the feature of `FabrixComponent`.
The biggest different between naively using `FabrixComponent` and the custom component builder is that users can define custom props that are passed down to the custom component to be used.

With the feature, some customizing usecases can be achieved such as:

* An extra column to the table
* Giving callback functions to the component
* Customizing the component's style
