`FabrixComponent` provides useful functions and data through its children prop. Once children prop is given to `FabrixComponent`, the React node returned from children completely overrides how the component is rendered.

This feature is expected to be used to decorate the component or modify styles of it in an ad-hoc way.

### Anatomy 

The terminalogies used in functions that children prop provides are coming from as follows:

<Image src={QueryAnatomyImage} alt="depiction of terminologies, operation is a GraphQL operation, and component is a top-level selection in the operation" />

## `getComponent`

`getComponent` is a function that renders a component associated to the operation and the included selection.

Fabrix renders components based on the selection in a GraphQL operation, so this function is the minimum unit to render a component.

```diff lang="tsx"
<FabrixComponent 
  query={`
    query getData {
      users {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          } 
        } 
      } 

      contacts {
        edges {
          node {
            name
            email
            phone
          } 
        } 
      }
    } 
  `}
>
  {({ getComponent }) => (
    <>
      <h1>Company list</h1>
+      {getComponent("getData", "contacts")}
    </>
  )}
</FabrixComponent>
```

## `getOperation`

`getOperation` is a function that renders a component associated to the operation name.

Fabrix supports multiple operations in `query` prop, so with this function users would be able to render components selectively.

```diff lang="tsx"
<FabrixComponent 
  query={`
    query getUsers {
      users {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          } 
        } 
      } 
    } 

    query getContacts {
      companies {
        edges {
          node {
            name
            email
            phone
          } 
        } 
      } 
    }
  `}
>
  {({ getOperation }) => (
    <>
      <h1>User list</h1>
+      {getOperation("getContacts")}
    </>
  )}
</FabrixComponent>
```

Plus, `getOperation` has a render prop in the second argument that gives us `getComponent` as well.

```diff lang="tsx"
<FabrixComponent 
  query={/* same query as the example above */}
>
  {({ getOperation }) => (
    <>
      <h1>User list</h1>
+      {getOperation("getUsers", ({ getComponent }) => (
+        getComponent("users")
+      ))}
    </>
  )}
</FabrixComponent>
```

## `data`

`data` is a raw value that is simply passed down from the fetched result.

```tsx
<FabrixComponent 
  query={`
    query getUsers {
      users {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
            email 
          } 
        } 
      } 
    } 
  `}
>
  {({ data }) => {
    /*
     * `data` has data as follows:
     * 
     * data.getUsers.users.edges[0].node.{id,name,email}
     * data.getUsers.uesrs.edges[1].node.{id,name,email}
     */
  }}
</FabrixComponent>
```
