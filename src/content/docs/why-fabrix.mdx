At [Tailor](https://tailor.tech), we frequently build frontend applications with numerous screens and heavy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, particularly in admin panels and ERP systems.

While generating type definitions and hooks from GraphQL is a common practice in React applications, this approach is often applied on a component-by-component basis. For applications requiring fine-tuned styling and high flexibility, this level of detail is necessary. However, in admin panels and ERP systems—where functionality and data management are prioritized over intricate styling—this granularity often becomes a burden.

Fabrix solves this problem by automating the rendering of React components from GraphQL queries and schemas, significantly streamlining the development of complex, data-driven applications.
