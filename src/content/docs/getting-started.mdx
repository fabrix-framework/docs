Fabrix is designed to work with React applications, so you’ll need to set up a React app using create-react-app or a similar tool before getting started.

## Install fabrix

To start using fabrix, simply install it from npm:

```bash
npm install --save @fabrix-framework/fabrix
```

## Install component package

Fabrix uses components to render different fields and data types. You can use the default components provided by fabrix (chakra-ui for now) or create your own custom components.

In this quick start, we will use fabrix with our chakra-ui package.

```bash
npm install --save @fabrix-framework/chakra-ui
```

## Add provider

Add `FabrixProvider` that configures fabrix in your app.

```tsx
import { FabrixProvider } from "@fabrix-framework/fabrix";
import { ChakraUIRegistry } from "@fabrix-framework/chakra-ui";

const Providers = (props: React.PropsWithChildren) => {
  return (
    <FabrixProvider
      url={"http://localhost:3000/graphql"}
      componentRegistry={ChakraUIRegistry}
    >
      {props.children}
    </FabrixProvider>
  )
}
```

The `url` prop specifies the endpoint of your GraphQL server. This is the URL where Fabrix will send queries and mutations to interact with your backend. It should point to your GraphQL server’s endpoint. 

In this example, `http://localhost:3000/graphql` is the URL where your GraphQL server is running. Replace this with the appropriate URL for your server.

The `componentRegistry` prop defines which components Fabrix should use to render different fields and data types. It acts as a mapping between GraphQL types and React components. Fabrix includes a default component registry, such as Chakra UI components, but you can also provide your own custom registry. See [Component registry](/guides/component-registry) for more detail.

All set! Now you can start using Fabrix in your app.
